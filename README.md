# jquery-global-wrapper

If you use browserify or webpack and you already have a global jQuery in place, you can reference it with this wrapper instead of bundeling another jQuery.

Add the wrapper to your `package.json` depencencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "jquery": "levito/jquery-global-wrapper"
}
```

jQuery plugins installed via `npm` will simply use the existing global jQuery.
